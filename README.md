Simple application controling fastapi funcs using tkinter graphical user interface and requests.

It's made only for learning and exercise.

It has two counters that works in separate threads.

It can create user by its name, surname, age, username and password and add it to the simple database.
Existing user can log in , log out, see user by its username and list all users, but nothinng more.

I just wanted to do something with fastapi. I don't know HTML, so I have started with GUI made with tkinter. As I progress, I will make more and more applications like this.
