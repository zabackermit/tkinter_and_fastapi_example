Simple application shich controls fastapi funcs using tkinter user interface and requests.

It has two counters that works in separate threads.

It can create user by its name, surname, age, username and password and add it to the simple database.
Existring user can log in , log out, see user by its username and to list all users and nothinng more.

I just wanted to do something with fastapi. I don't know HTML, so I have started with GUI made with tkinter.
